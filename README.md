# AI-powered-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System-P1

1.INTRODUCTION

The AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System is designed to assist recruiters in efficiently identifying the most suitable candidates for a given job role. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this system automates resume screening, saving time and improving hiring accuracy.

2.PROBLEM STATEMENT

In modern recruitment, organizations receive a vast number of resumes for each job opening. Manually reviewing these resumes is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. This project aims to automate the resume screening process by utilizing NLP techniques to rank resumes based on their relevance to the provided job description.

3.PROPESED SOLOUTION

The proposed solution utilizes a combination of TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to rank resumes based on relevance. A web application built using Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for job description input, resume uploads, and ranked result display.

4.SYSTEM DESIGN

The system architecture is composed of five key components:

4.2 DETAILED EXPLANATION

User Input and Frontend:
Users can enter the job description and upload multiple resumes in PDF format.

Backend Processing:
Resumes undergo parsing and text extraction to prepare data for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Extracted text is converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Similarity Computation:
The system calculates the similarity score using Cosine Similarity to assess how well each resume matches the job description.

Ranking and Output Display:
Results are stored, sorted, and displayed in ranked order.
